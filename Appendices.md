**Appendix A: CS Maturity Self-Assessment**

---------------

**Introduction: Understanding Your CS Maturity**

This self-assessment tool enables you to evaluate your organization's Customer Success maturity across six critical dimensions and identify priority areas for improvement. Unlike generic maturity models, this assessment is grounded in the frameworks and practices detailed throughout this handbook.

**How to Use This Assessment**

**Individual Assessment (30 minutes):** - Complete the assessment from your perspective - Score honestly---inflated scores hide real gaps - Note evidence for your scores; avoid guessing

**Team Assessment (60-90 minutes):** - Schedule facilitated session with CS leadership team - Each person completes independently first - Discuss score differences---they reveal blind spots - Reach consensus score or document range of perspectives - Identify top 2-3 priority gaps

**Cross-Functional Assessment (2 hours):** - Include Sales, Product, Finance leadership - Different functions often see maturity differently - Reveals organizational alignment (or lack thereof) - Identifies external dependencies

**Priority Identification Framework**

Use this framework to identify top 3-5 priority improvements:

**Step 1: Identify Lowest Scores**

List your three lowest dimension scores:

1\.	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Dimension: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) Score: \_\_\_/10

2\.	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Dimension: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) Score: \_\_\_/10

3\.	\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ (Dimension: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_) Score: \_\_\_/10

**Step 2: Assess Dependencies**

Some dimensions enable others. Assess dependencies using this framework:

| Priority Dimension | Blocks What? | Should Address First? |
| :----- | :----- | :----- |
| If Strategy \<5 | Everything | **YES** --- foundational |
| If Structure \<5 | Processes, Talent execution | **YES** --- foundational |
| If Technology \<5 | Measurement, Process execution | **Often** --- foundational |
| If Processes \<5 | Measurement, Talent accountability | **Maybe** --- after strategy/structure |
| If Talent \<5 | Outcomes, Retention | **Maybe** --- depends on other factors |
| If Measurement \<5 | Learning, Improvement | **No** --- fix foundation first |

**Step 3: Impact vs. Effort Assessment**

| Dimension | Business Impact if Fixed | Effort to Fix | Priority |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| Strategy | Highest | Medium-High | **HIGH** |
| Structure | High | Medium-High | **HIGH** |

The assessment is also available as a downloadable spreadsheet at www.boxwood-strategy.com, enabling easy scoring, comparison, and tracking over time.

**Appendix B: Key Benchmarks Reference**

---------------

**Introduction: Using Benchmarks Effectively**

Benchmarks provide context for goal-setting, performance evaluation, and investment justification. This appendix consolidates benchmark data referenced throughout the handbook into a single reference.

**How to Use This Reference**

**For Goal Setting:** - Identify your current quartile for each metric - Set targets to improve by one quartile within 12-18 months - Avoid setting "best-in-class" targets without foundation

**For Performance Evaluation:** - Compare your metrics to appropriate peer group - Consider company stage, segment mix, and product complexity - Use ranges rather than single-point targets

**For Investment Justification:** - Quantify gap between current state and target quartile - Calculate revenue impact of closing the gap - Build business case using benchmark-informed projections

**Important Caveats**

•	Benchmarks vary by industry, company stage, and business model

•	Use as directional guidance, not absolute standards

•	Your context matters---adjust for your specific situation

•	Benchmarks shift over time; validate against current sources

**Using These Benchmarks: Quick Reference**

**Performance Diagnostic**

**Step 1: Identify your quartile for key metrics**

| Metric | Your Value | Quartile | Priority? |
| :----- | :----- | :----- | :----- |
| NRR | \_\_\_\_% | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| GRR | \_\_\_\_% | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| Logo retention | \_\_\_\_% | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| Time-to-Value | \_\_\_\_ days | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| Cost-to-serve | \_\_\_\_% | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| NPS | \_\_\_\_ | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |
| Save rate | \_\_\_\_% | \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ | ☐ |

**Step 2: Set improvement targets**

For each metric in bottom two quartiles, set target to improve by one quartile within 12-18 months.

**Step 3: Calculate business impact**

Use retention and expansion benchmarks to model revenue impact of improvement.

TIPS FOR SUCCESS  
  
✓ The 80% rule: 80% of QBR quality is determined before the meeting  
✓ Lead with customer value: Frame everything in terms of their priorities  
✓ Listen to understand: Ask questions. Take notes. Pause for responses.  
✓ Get specific commitments: Vague action items create vague results  
✓ Use their language: Use their words for goals and priorities  
✓ Recognize wins: Celebrate successes before moving forward  
✓ Create urgency: Help them see why next steps matter  
✓ Follow up relentlessly: You're only as good as your follow-through

**Tips for Success:** - Complete all "Week before" items---they determine meeting quality - Use this checklist as a team training tool - Adapt for your customer segments (enterprise vs. SMB) - Review with CSMs during 1:1s to build capability
